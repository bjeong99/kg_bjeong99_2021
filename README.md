This is the online coding assessment for the Kargo Software Engineering Intern position.

I uploaded two files, one in Python and Java (which was an accepted coding language as stated in the instructions).
I decided to try the method in two languages because my idea for the solution involved using a Hashmap object, and it was much easier to implement that using Java.
Once I solidified that method, I wanted to show that it could also be done in Python which is a more preferred language.
I hope that using two languages is fine.
Thank you!
